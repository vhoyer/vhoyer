#### How I do pull request reviews

I have a system of tags, I mostyle begin all my comments on a review with `(tag)`, while tag can be:

<dl>
<dt><code>(resolvable)</code></dt>
  <dd>for silly comments where I just wanna point something funny with the author</dd>
<dt><code>(optional)</code></dt>
  <dd>things I think are somewhat relevant and I really would do if I was the author, but I won't block the PR because of them</dd>
<dt><code>(question)</code></dt>
  <dd>for questions, I will totally block the PR if you don't anwser my questions :joy: mostly because sometimes a question is intended to be more acertive on a <code>(important)</code>, but I will not request changes, because there is no request in a question, right?</dd>
<dt><code>(important)</code></dt>
  <dd>Absolutely important, I think the user experience will be damaged if this goes to production: or the site will break, or the performance will suffer, or the accessibility is broken, or I think this is gonna lower maintenability of the code in the future</dd>
<dt><code>sometimes I don't add any tag at all</code></dt>
  <dd>in those cases, treat the comment as slightly more important than a `optional` but way less than `important`</dd>
</dl>
